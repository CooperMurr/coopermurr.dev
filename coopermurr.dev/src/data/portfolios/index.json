    "description": "<p>One of the main reasons I worked at FAR-Labs in NYC was to pursue my personal research on augmenting the physical artist’s workflow. I focused on using the ShadeSketch ML model and the AxiDraw to detect line drawings and programmatically draw realistic shading on them from a given light direction. Shadowing can be challenging for novice physical artists, but once they have a robotic pen plotter shade for them, they begin to understand its intricacies.</p><p>Furthermore, with the robotic shading pipeline complete, I hope to run a user case study on the outcomes of this unique human-robotics interaction. Specifically, I will study how artists react to the robot’s shading capabilities and how that implies conclusions on future human-robotics interactions.</p>",

I spent a large portion of a summer programming with him to create a streamlined system that allows anyone to upload their own audio ML models and use them to control a small robot.</p><p>Through node-red, Google's Teachable Machines, and some backend development, we provided a simple process for building robots that naturally react to sounds in ways not possible to the average, non-technical person.</p><p>Links to both custom node-red nodes can be found on my GitHub.</p>",
